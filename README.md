# Cards_Classification
Classify cards according to the suits of the playing cards. There are four suits of cards: Hearts (red), Spades (black), Clubs (black), Diamonds (red). 
Our model can distinguish which image of the cards belongs to which suit. 
# Dataset Preparation
Playing cards have four suits; each suit has 13 types (eg: Hearts 1-10,J,K,Q). We created 52 folders for 13 types of each of the four suits. 
The number of images in each folder contains 14 images. (The number of images depends on the model you want to build)
